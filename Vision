Revision History

Intoduction:

We believe that Risk being able to be modeled for the course will give us a stronger understanding of ways to model objects in the future.

Positioning:

Business Opportunity
We believe that the idea of Risk as a board game that is highly played allows for a market for our product to be created for.  Risk is the
basis of most strategy games.

Problem Statement
Most Risk games require the user to learn the rules before playing the game leading to a long time of just studying rules.

Product Position Statement
The system Risk is for the beginner players who are trying to learn the rules of Risk for the first time.  Allowing them to develop strategies
through the tutoral style of play.  

Stakeholder Discriptions:

Market Demographics
The user base will be young kids wanting to learn the game.
